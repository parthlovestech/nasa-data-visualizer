# NASA Media Search and Visualization

This Python script allows users to search for media in the NASA Images API and visualize the search results using Plotly. It provides an interactive scatter plot of media items based on the search term provided by the user.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: The script uses the NASA Images API to search for media items related to a specific query.
- **Visualization**: The search results are visualized in a scatter plot, where each item is represented by a point. The color of the points indicates whether the item is an image (blue) or another media type (red).
- **Interactive Plot**: The plot is interactive, displaying the title of each item when hovered over.

## Installation

To run this script, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you need to install the following Python packages:

- `requests`
- `plotly`

You can install these packages using pip:
